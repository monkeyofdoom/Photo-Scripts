- Run Copy From Camera script
	This copies the raw files & movies off the card and into two folders, Temp and Temp 2. 
	Then renames the files to match their date taken.

- After this you deal with Temp more or less exclusively until you're done processing, 
	Temp 2 is there to provide a base backup in case you accidentally delete or corrupt the working copy in temp

- Start Digital Photo Professional (suite that comes with the camera), and go to Temp folder

- Select a group of images, I usually do groups of events together, or if there's too many for that, 30 or so at a time

- Immediately mark them as 'checkmark 3', which is just ALT+3. I mostly use a 3 checkmark system:
	1 = post to web/send to people, these are the really good ones
	2 = keep, but don't post, these usually also get copied to my tablet for individual showings
	3 = discard 
	
	The exception to this is when I'm doing stacked photos like stars, or 3-frame HDR photos, 
	both of which I mark as 4. This is because while I don't really want to keep the raw files 
	(I keep the processed tiff file instead), I don't want them deleted with the 3s.

- Then hit ctrl+right arrow, this takes you into the 'edit image' section, and brings with you the group you selected.

- Go through each image, and using the raw tab on the tool pallete, touch up brightness, saturation, 
	change the white balance and picture style, etc.

- If you're like me you'll also want to make use of the trimming angle tool from here, which lets you quickly and easily
	rotate the frame to level it, and do any cropping you want to do. The trimming tool picks 'free form' as the default
	aspect ratio, which lets you do whatever, but I prefer to keep the original ratio, which is 3:2 or 2:3 depending on
	shot rotation.

- As you're going through, mark each photo you want to keep with either a 1 or 2 checkmark (again with alt+1 or alt+2).
	Sometimes I have a ton of shots that are similar, and just want a quick weeding, so I'll pick a bunch and mark as 2,
	and then come back and compare the 2s more closely to trim out the rest and mark them as 1 or 2 again afterwards.

- When you're done with the group, ctrl+left arrow to get back to the folder view, and either move on to the next group, 
	or delete the checkmark 3s, by going to the 'edit' menu, picking the 'check mark' sub menu, 
	and pick 'select check mark 3 images only', I usually give a brief run through the folder view after to make sure it's
	only picking what I'm expecting (cause I'm paranoid), and then delete them.

- After that, you can go back and touch up individual photos more, or just move on to processing

- I go back to select check mark 1s first, and hit 'batch process'. I process my stuff to jpg form unless it's going to
	a stacking or HDR app, or I want to do more detailed photoshop work, in which case you want tiff files.

- Batch process, max quality, I export to a 'processed' folder.

- From the processed folder, I make copies into folders for the appropriate posting galleries, main, friends, family, special event, etc.

- Then I resize the ones in the event folders to 1280xwhatever (I use irfanview for this, it has a batch resize mode which is very nice)

- Then I go back to the originals in the processed folder and move them into my 'for tablet' folder.

- Then go back to the photo app, and do the same thing for 2s, but for 2s, they only just get moved into the 'for tablet' folder.

- Then back in the photo app, I move the photos I've processed into their respective archive folders. I archive the raw files only
	(aside from the processed resized files), cause I can just re-generate those, and I can do loss-free touchups later for printing or
	whatever if necessary. 

- Remember: jpgs are lossy, and you lose detail every time you save a change to it, whereas raw files not only aren't lossy, they 
	keep all the adjustments in a vector without altering the original, so you can just undo them back to the original if you want 
	at any time.

- Movie files I almost always convert to mkv with handbrake on a fairly decent quality setting, cause the size of those MOV files is
	just nuts, and I never edit movies afterwards. If I change that I may start keeping the originals, but I don't take that many, so
	it hasn't been a priority thus far.
